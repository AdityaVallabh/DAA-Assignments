## Questions

* Take a 10 x 10 matrix (n x n in general) filled with random integer numbers. Trace the longest sorted partition:-
  * in each column of the matrix
  * Trace the longest sorted child of the matrix.
* Assume a given set of unsorted numbers. You have to perform sorting. However, print the sorted numbers along with their original (initial) locations in the given array. Locate a key in the sorted array. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.
* Write an efficient algorithm to achieve the following. Given a set of numbers, find out the smallest and the largest numbers in the list. Swap the smallest with the first element and largest with the last element. Find the second smallest and second largest and swap them with their proper positions. Continue in this way until all the elements are sorted. Track the movement of every element in the list while sorting. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.
* This problem requires us to sort a given array using heap sort, while keeping track of the locations every element obtains as it moves around the array. The sort is a basic sorting scheme. Tracking the movement of the elements simply involves storing every new location that the elements obtain after they are swapped.
